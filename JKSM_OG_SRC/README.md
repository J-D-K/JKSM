# JKSM Rosalina
This is a fork from:
JKSM - JK's Save Manager
---
This version's 3DSX is only compatible with the Rosalina entrypoint of the Homebrew Launcher.
For the old *hax 3dsx please visit the original fork by JK.

WARNING: This fork moves the JKSV folder from the root of the sdcard to the "3ds/data/JKSM" folder. You must move your saves there before you are able to restore it.
